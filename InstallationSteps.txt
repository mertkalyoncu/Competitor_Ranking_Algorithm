Hello,

Here are the steps to install

1- Angular CLI and nodeJS should be installed. 

	for angularCLI : from command prompt => npm install @angular/cli -g
	for nodeJS : install from nodejs.org
	
2- I used SpringToolSuite for BE.
3- going to the directory of  competitor-ranking-FE in command prompt, type => npm install  
	after installation is completed, type=> ng serve
4- For BE, maven update project and build.
5- When both BE and FE is running, from browser go to  'localhost:/4200'


The code is working without a problem on my computer so i wouldnt expect a problem but if you face a problem running the project, please let me know.

Best Regards
Mert Kalyoncu
